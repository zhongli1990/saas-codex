## 1. Recommended License Model

### Dual Licensing (Open Core + Commercial)

For your requirements, I recommend a **Dual Licensing** model with **Revenue-Based Tiers**:

| Tier | Criteria | License | Cost |
|------|----------|---------|------|
| **Community** | Revenue < £250K/year | AGPL-3.0 | Free |
| **SME Sponsor** | Revenue £250K-£2M | Commercial Lite | £500/year |
| **Enterprise** | Revenue > £2M | Commercial Enterprise | Custom pricing |

### Why This Model Works

1. **AGPL-3.0 for Community**
   - Strong copyleft: Any modifications must be shared
   - Network clause: SaaS deployments must share source
   - Protects against "taking without giving back"

2. **Commercial License for Larger Orgs**
   - Removes AGPL obligations
   - Includes support/SLA
   - Generates revenue

---

## 2. License Options Comparison

### Option A: AGPL-3.0 + Commercial (Recommended)

**Pros**:
- Strong IP protection (network copyleft)
- Used by MongoDB, Grafana, Nextcloud
- Forces commercial users to either contribute or pay
- Well-tested legally

**Cons**:
- Some enterprises avoid AGPL entirely
- May reduce adoption

### Option B: BSL (Business Source License)

**Pros**:
- Used by MariaDB, CockroachDB, Sentry
- Converts to open source after time period (e.g., 3 years)
- Clear commercial terms

**Cons**:
- Not OSI-approved "open source"
- More complex to explain

### Option C: Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)

**Pros**:
- Used by Elastic, Confluent
- Simple terms
- Prevents cloud providers from reselling

**Cons**:
- Not OSI-approved
- Relatively new

### Option D: Commons Clause + Apache/MIT

**Pros**:
- Simple addition to permissive license
- Prevents selling the software

**Cons**:
- Controversial in OSS community
- Legally untested

## 3. IP Protection Strategies

### Technical Protections

| Strategy | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Copyright Headers** | Add to all source files | High |
| **License File** | LICENSE in repo root | High |
| **Contributor Agreement** | CLA for external contributors | High |
| **Trademark Registration** | Register "SaaS Codex" | Medium |
| **Code Signing** | Sign releases | Medium |
| **Proprietary Components** | Keep some features closed | High |

### Legal Protections

1. **Copyright Assignment/CLA**
   - All contributors assign copyright to Lightweight Integration Ltd
   - Or grant perpetual license to relicense
   - Required for dual licensing to work

2. **Trademark Protection**
   - Register "SaaS Codex" as trademark
   - Prevents others from using the name commercially

3. **Patent (Optional)**
   - Consider for novel algorithms
   - Expensive but strong protection

### What You CAN Protect

| Asset | Protection Method |
|-------|-------------------|
| Source code | Copyright + License |
| Brand name | Trademark |
| Documentation | Copyright |
| Algorithms | Patent (optional) |
| Trade secrets | Keep proprietary |

### What You CANNOT Fully Protect

| Asset | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Ideas/concepts | Not copyrightable |
| APIs | Limited protection |
| Functionality | Can be reimplemented |

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Copyright Headers to All Files

```python
# Copyright (c) 2026 Lightweight Integration Ltd
# 
# This file is part of SaaS Codex.
# 
# SaaS Codex is dual-licensed:
# - AGPL-3.0 for organizations with annual revenue below £250,000
# - Commercial license for all other organizations
# 
# See LICENSE file for details.
```

### Step 2: Create LICENSE File

See Section 5 below.

### Step 3: Create Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Required for all external contributors to sign before PRs are merged.

### Step 4: Add License Check to CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/license-check.yml
- name: Check license headers
  run: |
    find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | \
    xargs grep -L "Copyright.*Lightweight Integration Ltd" && exit 1 || exit 0
```

### Step 5: Register Trademark

- Apply to UK IPO for "SaaS Codex" trademark
- Cost: ~£170-£270 for UK registration
- Consider EU trademark (~€850) for broader protection

## 8. FAQ

**Q: Can someone fork and compete with us?**
A: Under AGPL, yes, but they must:
- Keep it open source
- Share all modifications
- Include the same license
- Cannot use our trademark

**Q: What if a large company uses it without paying?**
A: Under AGPL, if they deploy it as a service, they must share their source code. If they don't want to, they must buy a commercial license.

**Q: Can we change the license later?**
A: Yes, if you own all the copyright (via CLA from contributors). This is why the CLA is essential.

**Q: Is AGPL enforceable?**
A: Yes, it has been enforced in court (e.g., Artifex vs Hancom). The copyleft provisions are legally binding.
